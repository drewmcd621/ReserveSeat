## Requirements
* Python 2 (Tested on Python 2.7.12)

## Usage
In this repo you will find 2 files main.py and seating.py.  main.py is a demo of the usage of this application, seating.py is the application.

seating.py has 3 functions:

### build(rows, cols, reserved):
builds the seating map

* rows: (int) the number of rows
* cols: (int) the number of columns (a.k.a. seats per row)
* reserved: (array) a 1D array of strings representing the seats that are already reserved (formatted as "R1C1")

returns: map: (array) a 2D array representing the seats

### reserve(map, n):
Reserves the best seats for n contiguous seats.  Prints their location.

* map: (array) generated by build above
* n: (int) the number of seats to reserve

returns: map: (array) the updated map

### toStr(map):
Converts the map to a string representation

* map: (array) returned from either build or reserve

returns: map (string) the string representation

To read:
* 0 - empty seat
* V - A seat pre-reserved by build (a **V**IP seat)
* R - A **R**eserved seat

The front row is at the top.
